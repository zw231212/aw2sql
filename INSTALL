Basic Installation
==================

    1st: Copy aw2sql.pl script to the awstats directory

    2nd: Edit aw2sql.pl and change the values of:
          $DataDir   => Directory where you store the awstats temp files
          $dbuser    => You must select a username
          $dbpass    => You must select a password
          $dbhost    => Where is MySQL server?

          Ex:
            $DataDir = '/www/awstats'
            $dbuser  = 'myuser'
            $dbpass  = 'secret'
            $dbhost  = 'localhost'

    3rd: # chown root:root aw2sql.pl

    4th: # chmod 711 aw2sql.pl

    5th: Create the database into MySQL. The default database is "mysite"_log.
      ï¿½What this means? If your site is www.mysite.com, and you have an awstats'
      config file named: "awstats.mysite.conf", you will generate a temp file
      with the name: "awstats022005.mysite.txt".
      The numbers are month and year (022005 == february 2005).
      You must create this database before running the script. In this version,
      the script doesn't create the database.

    6th: Run the script
        $ ./aw2sql.pl -config=mysite

         You can run the script and generate a specific month/year with
        $ ./aw2sql.pl -config=mysite -month=12 -year=2004

    Note: You only can use awstats temp files with text format, don't use
     the xml format!!
